# Portfolio
 Here is my portfolio. I used NextJS for the first time.

 In this portfolio, i try a lot of things so my code isn't really clear right now.
 Sometimes i tried using module.css, sometimes JSX css in javascript or just a global css.

 I created a Json data file to pretend reading a database in my getStaticProps.

 I'm currently working on the V1, my goal, some pages using SSR and other paging using SSG not form performance, only to try everything i can.

 Now? 
	- My app is using my mongodb database (The code is in comment in my repo for now)
	- Working on a deploying my app 

 And next?
   - CLEAN MY CSS CODE !!!!
