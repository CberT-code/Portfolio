# Portfolio
 Here is my portfolio. I used NextJS for the first time.

 In this portfolio, i try a lot of things so my code isn't really clear right now.
 Sometimes i tried using module.css, sometimes JSX css in javascript or just a global css.

 I created a Json data file to pretend reading a database in my getStaticProps.

 I'm currently working on the V1, so the actual project is not responsive, the datas are not the final datas and some buttons dont work yet.

 The V1 will be full SSG(static site generation).

 I'm working on : 
   - Insert the good datas
   - Finish the website

 And next?
   - CLEAN MY CODE and work on tailwindcss
   - Create a DB and render SSG and SSR pages
